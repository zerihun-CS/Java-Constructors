# Java-Constructors

What is a Constructor?

A constructor in Java is similar to a method that is invoked when an object of the class is created.

Unlike Java methods, a constructor has the same name as that of the class and does not have any return type. For example,

```class Test {
  Test() {
    // constructor body
  }
}
```
